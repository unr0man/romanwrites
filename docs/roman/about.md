Hello visitor. 

Welcome to Roman Writes ~ my little corner of cyber space.

There's not much you need to know about me:
- I'm a citizen of earth.
- I'll be posting short essays and stories here. Stay tuned for the occasional love letter and diatribe.
- Got feedback? Email me, the author, with your questions, comments, rants, objections--aesthetic or ethical.

That's about it.

Hope you find something you like. Hope you stay awhile.

~Roman
